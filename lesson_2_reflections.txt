What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need it?

When you init a new repository, you create a
file that holds histories of all files you'd
like to track. It helps for tracking changes
to files and coding etc.

How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an in-between state that 
helps mediate between the two. It adds value 
that you can confirm what you want to commit 
before you do

How can you use the staging area to make sure 
you have one commit per logical change?

You can always use git diff to see what changes
you would make and ensure that it is the correct
amount of changes
