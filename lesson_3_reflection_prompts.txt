When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use a remote repository when I plan on editing my work
    from a different computer or when I want to work with other individuals.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you make any changes to your GitHub remote repository that you don't
    necessarily want to be updated on your local GitHub repository then
    you should be always pulling your changes manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clones are copies of repositories - forks are clones that are exclusive
    to GitHub. Branches are different paths of repositories so that someone
    can make changes that might or might not ever be merged into a single
    branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If you have a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally,
    you can use that copy as a separate branch of the remote repository. Once
    you are ready to share your changes with others, you can pull, merge, and
    push the new changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would collaborate with others by using either G Suite (because of its
    collaborative nature) or I would send a set of scripts back and forth
    between myself and my collaborators. It would be much, much harder to
    see what changes were actually made than when using GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
