It helped me because it showed me exactly where changes were made

You'd be able to see where parts of your program succeeded or failed
in the past

Manually choosing to commit is nice because you can put logic behind
commmits
you autosaves mixed with commits might be nice as well

I think that Git is more organized around projects whereas Drive is
organized in any format you want (technically defaults to single 
files)

you can use git log and git diff to find the history (and marked)
changes, as well as the actual changes themselves (respectively)

If you use version control and save regularly, it is safer to 
make a change that you know may fail because you could always
revert it

I want to use Git to create and manage code more efficiently
